I'm an undergrad at Boston University studying Statistics + Computer Science and a Research Affiliate at Harvard SEAS who also enjoys sailing and hiking. My work mainly involves working on computer vision and robotic control, but I love to explore other fields. You can see more of my work on my [website](https://thisistim.dev).
