I'm a research intern at MIT who also enjoys sailing and hiking. My work mainly invovles computer vision, but I love to explore other fields. I've worked with Firebase, Tensorflow, webXR, React.js, Blender, Arduinos, and Raspberry Pis. I want to make a technology a more immersive and inclusive space, and you can see more of my work on my [website](https.thisistim.dev).
