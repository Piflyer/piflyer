# Hi, I'm Tim Nguyen.
![Profile](https://github.com/Piflyer/piflyer/raw/master/git-profile.png)
I'm a teenager that enjoys writing code in my free time. I mainly focus on working with HTML/CSS/JS. I am passionate about making the world a better place to live through technology. I am also passionate about making information more accessible to everyone through visually appealing interfaces. I also enjoy designing 3D models though Blender and making them come to life with WebXR. You can see examples of some 3D models I have made with Blender on my website. I am an avid Android fan, and I also like working SBCs like Raspberry Pis. You also can find me throughout various places on the web.
